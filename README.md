# Information Security — Final Exam Prep (Theory + Numericals)

This repository contains **beginner-friendly, exam-focused** Markdown notes for an Information Security final.
The notes are designed for **short questions, theory, and numericals** (no MCQs).

## How to use this repo (recommended)
1) Read the **Quick tables** and **step-by-step recipes** in each module.
2) Do the **Numericals (solved drills)** once while reading.
3) Then cover the solutions and redo the same numericals from scratch.
4) Finally, attempt the **Practice questions** under exam timing.

A good daily routine (45–90 minutes):
- 10 min: skim quick tables + memorize checklist
- 25–45 min: numericals drills (write every step)
- 10–20 min: short-theory answers (define + one example)

## AES MixColumns numericals (extra drill sheet)
- [MixColumns - AES GF(2^8) Solved Examples.md](MixColumns%20-%20AES%20GF(2%5E8)%20Solved%20Examples.md)

## High-yield numericals to master
- **Risk math:** $Risk \approx Likelihood\times Impact$, $SLE=AV\times EF$, $ALE=SLE\times ARO$
- **Brute force time:** worst vs average case; seconds → hours → days
- **AES GF(2^8):** multiply-by-02/03 (xtime), and inverse constants (09/0B/0D/0E)
- **Modes (CBC/CTR/GCM):** XOR logic, padding length (PKCS#7), nonce/IV rules
- **RSA:** $\varphi(n)$, modular inverse (extended Euclid), square-and-multiply

## Notes
- Everything is written as Markdown so you can read it directly in VS Code.
- If you want, tell me your university’s typical numerical difficulty (easy/moderate/hard) and I can scale the drill sets accordingly.
